This study follows an approach adopted by (Green, 2007), (Liu and Wang, 2016) and (Li, 2020), which utilizes a measure of polycentricity based on using characteristics of city as metric and calculating the degree of standard deviation of a city's metric from the maximum possible standard deviation value: 
$P=1-obs(max)$
whereas P quantifies the polycentricity of an individual city, with obs representing the observed standard deviation of the importance of individual centres within the city. The term max refers to the maximum possible standard deviation in a hypothetical two-centre city where one centre has no importance and the other possesses the maximum observed importance or can be seen as a form of monocentric city. Essentially, the fraction $obs(max)$ compares the observed distribution of centre 'importance' in each city to this extreme monocentric case. This method yields a normalized measure of polycentricity, which varies from 0 to 1. A score of 0 indicates no polycentricity (a monocentric city), whereas a score of 1 indicates a city with multiple centres of equal importance. In cases where a city has only one centre, the polycentricity score would be zero. 
The threshold is calculated using a predetermined percentileâ€”specifically, a percentage that represents the point at which the most densely populated or economically active areas fall. For example, if the cut-off is set to 70 percentiles, it indicates that the highest density values exceed the threshold selected. As a result, counties with population or enterprise density above this level are considered potential city centres.
